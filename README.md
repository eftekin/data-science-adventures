# Data Science Adventures

Welcome to the Data Science Adventures repository! This is where I document my journey of learning and exploring the exciting world of data science using the Python programming language. This repository serves as a collection of projects, code examples, and resources that I've gathered along the way.

## Getting Started

If you're new to the field of data science or looking to enhance your Python skills for data analysis, consider checking out these resources:

- [Official Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/): The definitive guide to the Python programming language.
- [Python.org](https://www.python.org/): The official Python website for updates, documentation, and more.
- [Python for Data Science Tutorials](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html): Python tutorials that provide a solid foundation for data science tasks.
- [Learn Python](https://www.learnpython.org/): An interactive platform for learning Python through hands-on exercises.
- [Data Science Courses on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/): Explore various data science courses, including offerings from top universities.

## Repository Contents

This repository is organized into the following sections (The progress bar is kept up to date as I progress through the courses.):

- **Data Scientist: Machine Learning Career Path (Codecademy)** ![](https://geps.dev/progress/48): Includes resources from the "Data Scientist Career Path" on Codecademy.
- **Python for Data Science (Coursera - IBM)** ![](https://geps.dev/progress/100): Contains materials from the "Python for Data Science" course by IBM on Coursera.
- **Computer Programming II** ![](https://geps.dev/progress/100): Contains the answers to the lab questions of my Programming II course.
