# Write a Python program to find the area of a triangle.

# Input the base and height from the user
base = float(input("Enter the base of triangle: "))
height = float(input("Enter the height of triangle: "))

# Calculate the area of the triangle
area = 0.5 * base * height

# Print the area
print("The area of the triangle is " + str(area))
